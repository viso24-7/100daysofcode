          differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the
          exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal
         it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

     <p contenteditable="true">Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In 
         a comic,you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
         most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of
         the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

          this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you
          this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case
           to hand it over to your dumb ass.
